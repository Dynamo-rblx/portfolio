# Background



I am well-versed in Roblox development and team/project management. I have been scripting since 2018, and I love to spend time learning new things (not just about scripting) and honing my skills. When it comes to working on a team, I have lots of experience. However, most of those experiences have been negatively impacted by bad team members and bad leaders. That said, working on a team after establishing that synergy and chain-of-command you need is one of my favorite parts of game development. I have also tutored a few people in lua scripting (for 3 months). I am also a past beta tester for Winds of Fortune and Chilly Room (creator of Soul Knight).

# Roller_Bott's Creations

**Note:** Some repositories are not *fully filled* with the game code, so that you can tell which scripts were created by me. Also, some demo videos could not be included, because they exceed the 10 MB file size limit. This list is not of everything I have made, but it showcases a variety.
